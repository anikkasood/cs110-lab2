Tic Tac Toe game

Basic Requirements

+ Allow for two players to take turns. Assume X always starts the game. 
+ Detect when the game ends (when there is no more possible moves, i.e. all squares have either an X or an O). 
+ Detect when a player wins. To win, the player must get three of their pieces (X or O) in a row.
+ Output message to indicate whether its player X's turn or player O's turn. 
+ Maintain the score for each player, i.e. the number of games that player has won. There should be a "Reset" button that resets the scores as well as the board. 
+ Maintain an array that holds the squares that contain Xs and one that holds the moves made by O. You can use this array to determine if 9 moves have been made and whether its a tie, or whether the current player who made the move just won the game. 
+ Create a New Game button that resets the board and starts a new game. 
+ Your design should look similar to the above prototype but you can be create in your design as long the required elements are included.
